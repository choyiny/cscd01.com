    "1. Notice the the below code block has `import config`, find the `config.py` file (in the same directory) and put your openai API key in here.  If you do not have one yet, create a new account and refer to [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) to find your openai API key. \n",

    "3. Run the block below once the above 2 are done so setup the environment."

    "```\n",
    "poem_template = \"\"\"\n",

    "Poem analysis for:\n",
    "{haiku}\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And we chained them together like this: `overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[poem_chain, analysis_chain], verbose=True)`\n",
