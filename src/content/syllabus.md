# Course Objectives

A famous [report](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/chaos_report_1994.pdf) published
by The Standish Group in 1995 showed that only 16.2% of software projects succeed - the remaining
projects had functionalities descoped, went over budget, overtime, or just straight out canceled. We
still face the same problems nearly 30 years later - even with faster and better development tools,
and a more iterative approach for developing software - agile.

Our goal in this course is to learn how to make software projects successful from a technical
perspective. From better technical collaboration techniques with git to breaking down client
requirements into a cohesive architectural proposal, we are going to learn the current industry
standard practices. Most importantly, we will learn how to be a core part of delivering a successful
software project as a software engineer.

# Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Contribute to open-source software with industry best practices
- Make smart technology choices and decisions
- Extracting architectural characteristics from business requirements
- Communicate effectively with others on software architecture and design
- Create industry-standard design documents to express architectural ideas
- Raise architectural risk and design mitigation strategies

# Prerequisites

For specific prerequisite requirements see the UTSC Registrar.

# Course Staff

We encourage you to post questions regarding course materials and assignments on Slack. However, if
you need extended support, the course staff will hold office hours. Please contact course staff via
Slack direct message, we will not respond to any emails.

# Course Information

- [The course website and its Github repository](https://github.com/choyiny/cscd01.com)

One of the nice things about using Github for the course website is that you can contribute to the
course website. If you see something on the course website that should be fixed, or want to improve
the UI, please feel free to submit a pull request.

- [Slack](https://utsc-cscd01.slack.com/join/signup#/domain-signup)

The slack #general channel is the best place to ask technical questions, and general questions about
the course, assignments and project. For personal issues, please private message either instructor. I try to respond by the end of the next day. However, due to volume, it may take longer, especially on weekends.

- [Anonymous Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/jo2WahYMYh7RdgSi9)

If you have feedback about the course, you can send an anonymous feedback to the course instructor
(you also have the option of including your name). Since the sender cannot be determined, comments
sent through the feedback form are considered public, and they may receive a response at the beginning
of class or on Slack.

# Marking Scheme

Group work and individual tutorial quizzes will be used to compute a composite numeric score that will
determine your final letter grade for the course:

| Coursework                        | Weight |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Team Formation and Team Agreement | 2%     |
| Group Open Source Project         | 18%    |
| Group Presentation                | 20%    |
| Group Assignment                  | 30%    |
| Tutorial Quizzes                  | 30%    |

# Submission and Grading Policy

Please read the coursework handout carefully as it contains instructions on how to submit your work.

For group work, the instructor reserves the right to assign different grades to each of the team
members based on their individual contributions made to the team repository.

For your work to be graded, it must meet the minimum standards of a professional computer scientist.
All files required to build the program must be committed to the repository, and the program must
work. Last minute difficulties with git can easily be avoided by ensuring all files are added to the
repository well before the deadline, and that you know how to commit them. Your submission may receive
a grade of 0, if we cannot get any part of it to work.

No late submissions will be accepted for any course work, and no make-up quizzes will be provided
for missed/poorly completed work. It is your responsibility to ensure that all work is completed on
time and to the best of your ability.

If an emergency arises that prevents you from being able to complete any piece of work, or attend a
quiz, contact one of the instructors immediately. You must first declare your absence on ACORN with
the Absence Declaration. Note that starting Fall 2023, the Absence Declaration is going to be limited to one time use each term, up to a maximum of 7 days. That declaration can/should be used for missing any academic obligations (class, quiz, mid-term, etc.). After students have used their one absence declaration in the term, further accommodations regarding missed work, make-ups, etc. will be at the discretion of the instructor.

If a piece of work has been mis-marked or if you believe the rubric used to evaluate the work is not
appropriate, you may request a remark. For a remark to succeed, you must clearly and concisely express
what you believe was mis-marked. To request a remark, please contact your TA. Requests must be submitted within 1 week of the marks being returned.

# Academic Integrity

You are expected to comply with the [Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019).

Assignments must be prepared individually, except where an assignment handout allows working with a partner. Note that working with a partner may be restricted to just part of an assignment, such as programming task, whereas the rest of the assignment must be solved by an individual.

For group work, you are fully responsible for the piece of work you submit to the team project as your contribution to the group work.

You may discuss assignments with other students, for example to clarify the requirements of coursework, to work through examples that help you understand the technology used for an assignment, or to learn how to configure your system to run a supporting piece of software used in an assignment. However, collaboration at the level of answering written questions, is strictly forbidden. Written problems must be answered by you alone, using the text, your own notes, and other texts and Web sources as aids.

Do not let other students look at your assignment solutions, since this can lead to copying. Remember
you are in violation of the UTSC Academic Code whether you copy someone elseâ€™s work or allow someone
else to copy your work. These rules are meant to ensure that all students understand their solutions
well enough to prepare the solutions themselves. If challenged you must be able to reproduce and
explain your work.

You are not allowed to ask for help outside the course. Asking for help anywhere else online or in
private chat groups (unless the private group chat was set up between the group members of the same
group project) will be considered as unauthorized help.

The course staff reserves the right to use code and text analysis tools to compare your submission
with others to verify that no improper collaboration has occurred.

Failure to comply with these guidelines is a serious academic offence. In past academic offense cases,
the Associate Dean has imposed penalties for code violations that range from a mark of zero on
plagiarized assignments to academic suspension from the University.
