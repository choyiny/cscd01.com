# Overview

An architectural kata is an exercise that aims to train software architects. The purpose of this presentation is for your team to demonstrate the following learning objectives:

- Understanding the domain requirements and concerns
- Extracting architecture characteristics from requirements
- Presenting and defending your decisions

# Schedule your presentation

Your presentation will happen from October 23rd to November 3rd during TA’s office hours or your dedicated tutorial. The TAs will set up appointment scheduling links. The spots are released on a first-come-first-serve basis.

# 72 hours prior to your presentation

The TA will release an architectural kata scenario to your team through your dedicated group Slack channel.

Your team is to spend at most 1 hour to meet up and prepare everything you need for a verbal presentation with your TA.

# 24-72 hours prior to your presentation

Meanwhile, you are able to ask questions in your group Slack channel to the TA. The TA will roleplay the various domain stakeholders of your kata. You may ask them questions to clarify the requirements and concerns of the stakeholders.

The TAs will try their best to answer legitimate questions in a reasonable timeframe, but note that you are not their only team so do not expect them to be able to answer your questions immediately.

> Note: Please do not show other students your kata that is not from your team. Doing this will be considered academic misconduct.

# Part 1: Presentation (5 minutes)

Your team shall choose 2 members (or whatever makes half the team) to present your findings. You may show simple diagrams (like the ones shown in lecture) to support your presentation.

# Part 2: Q&A (8 minutes)

Your team shall choose the members who haven’t spoken yet to answer questions from the TA. Your other team members shall not attempt to assist them in answering questions.

The TAs will ask questions related to:

- Clarification of your presentation
- Your plans for the future
- Tradeoffs you made when selecting your architecture characteristics
