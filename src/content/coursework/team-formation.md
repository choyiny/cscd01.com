# Overview

Throughout the semester, your team will complete 3 team projects:

- Project: Open Source Contribution with langchain
- Presentation: Verbal Kata
- Assignment: Creating a Design Document

# Team Formation (1%)

You must spend your best effort to form a team of 4 in your tutorial. You are not allowed to have team members from another tutorial.

After forming a team, create a team name and a private channel between your team and your TA.

To get full credit, you must form your team on or before your third tutorial. Create a team name and a Slack channel between your team and your tutorial TA. Introduce yourself to each other.

# Team Agreement (1%)

Your team agreement is a binding document between your team, in case of conflict arises. The team agreement governs the contribution factor for each group activity. The contribution factor may be between 0%-110%.

Your team agreement should cover how the contribution factor should be affected in the following situations.

- When a team member is unreachable or unresponsive (please specify the response times clearly)
- When a team member misses a scheduled meeting
- When a team member drops out
- When a team member is unable to complete their part of the activity

Your team agreement can also optionally contain other situations in which the contribution factor is affected. This is up to the discretion of the team.

To get full credit, your team agreement must be signed by all team members by the third week.

# Arbitration with TA

Although rare, sometimes, team members are not able to work with each other due to various reasons. At any time, if any member feels like the team agreement should be enforced, they should set up a private meeting with the TA to discuss the matter.

Please raise this issue only as a last resort.

The TA will use the team agreement to make a final decision on the contribution factor for each team member. The TA will not apply adjustments that are out of the scope of the team agreement, and also will not enforce team agreements that are overly vague.

If you are unsatisfied with the result, please ask the TA to reach out to the course instructors for a final decision.

# Submission

Please submit your team agreeemnt to the Google doc shared to you by the TA by the deadline.
